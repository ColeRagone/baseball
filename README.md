# Baseball Analytics - Personal Project

# Overview: 

William & Maryâ€™s baseball program recently purchased TrackMan, a radar system that uses Doppler technology to track and record characteristics of sports balls in motion. In the context of baseball, this means that TrackMan can track and record pitch speed, location, movement, exit velocity, launch angle and direction. This information can be displayed with a user-friendly interface on the web, however, the program allows us to extract the information in forms of csv files, one of which was used to make the models within this project. 
The goal of this project is to use TrackMan in unison with another baseball technological breakthrough, Synergy, to suggest real-time pitches to coaches. Combining historic data on pitcher and batter matchups using Synergy with real-time pitch analysis and game feedback with TrackMan, we can use predictive analytics to suggest certain course of actions to pitching coaches during an at-bat. We can use information through TrackMan to gauge the effectiveness of pitches in real-time and compare them to the historical averages against the appropriate hitter, accounting for game scenarios to make our suggestions. 
This is an ongoing project, and we are currently waiting for approval to incorporate synergy data into our predictive analytics. Focus so far has been on creating a feedback algorithm on pitches in various counts, with the objective being to minimize expected damage with runners on base and maximize whiff-rates with bases empty. 
The rest of the files within this repository are other, smaller, personal projects. These include simple player analysis using matplotlib, strike zone accuracy, and an intersquad summary method that may be useful for coaches.
